## What is a Database and Why Does It Exist?

A database is an organized collection of structured data that allows users to store, retrieve, manage, and manipulate information efficiently. Databases exist to solve the problem of data organization, storage, and retrieval, ensuring that data remains consistent, accessible, and secure.

### Why Do Databases Exist?

- **Data Organization**: Helps structure and manage vast amounts of data.  
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains accuracy and consistency over time.  
- **Data Security**: Protects sensitive data with access control and encryption.  
- **Efficient Querying**: Allows fast searches and retrieval of information.  
- **Multi-user Access**: Supports multiple users accessing data simultaneously.  
- **Backup & Recovery**: Ensures data can be restored in case of failures.  

## Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)** ‚Äì MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.  
- **NoSQL Databases** ‚Äì MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.  
- **Graph Databases** ‚Äì Neo4j.  
- **Key-Value Stores** ‚Äì Amazon DynamoDB.  

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases. It allows users to interact with databases by performing operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

### Key Features of SQL

- **Declarative Language**: Describes what needs to be done, not how to do it.  
- **Data Querying**: Uses `SELECT` statements to retrieve data.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Supports `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` commands.  
- **Data Definition**: Creates and modifies schema using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.  
- **Transaction Control**: Ensures consistency using `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.  

### Example SQL Queries

```sql
-- Retrieve all users
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Insert a new user
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Update user email
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

# RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

## What is RDBMS?
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of database management system that stores data in a **structured format using tables, rows, and columns**. It follows the **relational model**, meaning data is organized with relationships between tables using **primary keys and foreign keys**.

### Key Features:
- **Structured Storage**: Data is stored in tables.
- **Relationships**: Uses keys (Primary, Foreign) to link tables.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability** for transactions.
- **SQL Support**: Uses **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for querying and managing data.
- **Scalability & Security**: Supports multi-user environments with access control.

### Examples of RDBMS:
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MySQL**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Oracle Database**
- **SQLite**

## RDBMS vs DBMS

| Feature          | **RDBMS** (Relational DBMS) | **DBMS** (Database Management System) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Structure** | Stores data in tables (rows & columns) | Stores data as files, hierarchical, network, or object-based |
| **Relationships** | Uses **Primary & Foreign keys** | No strict relationships between data |
| **Data Integrity** | Follows **ACID properties** for consistency | Does not necessarily follow ACID |
| **Query Language** | Uses **SQL** for data manipulation | May use **SQL, NoSQL, or other custom queries** |
| **Normalization** | Supports **normalization** to reduce redundancy | No strict normalization rules |
| **Security** | Better security with access control & permissions | Less secure compared to RDBMS |
| **Examples** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle | MongoDB, Redis, XML Databases, File Systems |

### Summary:
- **RDBMS is a subset of DBMS** that follows a structured relational model.
- **DBMS includes both relational and non-relational databases.**

## Naming Conventions in RDBMS

Following a good **naming convention** improves **readability, maintainability, and consistency** in databases.

### Best Practices for Naming Conventions:

| **Item**         | **Best Practice** | **Example** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Tables**       | Use **singular nouns** | `User`, `Order`, `Product` (NOT `Users`, `Orders`) |
| **Columns**      | Use lowercase & underscores (snake_case) | `first_name`, `created_at`, `order_id` |
| **Primary Key**  | Name as `id` or `[table]_id` | `id`, `user_id`, `order_id` |
| **Foreign Key**  | Reference parent table with `_id` | `user_id` (FK to `User.id`) |
| **Indexes**      | Prefix with `idx_` + table + column(s) | `idx_user_email` |
| **Constraints**  | Prefix with `chk_`, `fk_`, `pk_`, `uq_` | `pk_user_id`, `fk_order_user_id` |
| **Procedures**   | Use `sp_` + action + object | `sp_get_user_orders` |
| **Views**        | Prefix with `vw_` + purpose | `vw_active_users` |
| **Boolean Columns** | Use `is_` or `has_` prefix | `is_active`, `has_discount` |
| **Timestamps**   | Use `_at` for clarity | `created_at`, `updated_at` |

### Example Table Schema (Following Conventions):

```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Conclusion
- **RDBMS** is a structured database system based on tables and relationships.
- **RDBMS vs DBMS**: RDBMS is more structured, secure, and relational, while DBMS includes a broader range of storage models.
- **Naming conventions** ensure clarity and consistency in database design.

## Relations in Databases

### 1. One-to-One (1:1)
- Each record in **Table A** is associated with exactly one record in **Table B** and vice versa.
- Example: **A person and their passport** (Each person has one passport, and each passport belongs to one person).

### 2. One-to-Many (1:M)
- A single record in **Table A** can be related to multiple records in **Table B**, but each record in **Table B** is related to only one record in **Table A**.
- Example: **A customer and their orders** (A customer can place multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one customer).

### 3. Many-to-Many (M:N)
- Multiple records in **Table A** can be related to multiple records in **Table B**.
- Implemented using a **junction table** (or bridge table).
- Example: **Students and courses** (A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students).

## Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

### **What is Write-Ahead Logging?**
- A **database consistency** mechanism where changes are first written to a log before being applied to the main database.
- Ensures **durability (D) in ACID** properties.
- Helps in **crash recovery**.

### **How it Works:**
1. A change (transaction) is recorded in a **WAL log file** before modifying the actual database.
2. If a crash occurs before changes are fully committed, the system can replay the WAL log and restore consistency.

### **Benefits of WAL:**
- Faster writes (since logs are sequential).
- Better crash recovery.
- Concurrency control.

## Normalization vs Denormalization

### **Normalization**
- The process of organizing a database to **reduce redundancy** and **improve integrity**.
- Achieved through **normal forms** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.).
- Reduces data duplication by breaking large tables into **smaller related tables**.

### **Denormalization**
- The process of **combining tables** to improve **read performance** at the cost of redundancy.
- Used in **data warehouses** and **high-performance read-heavy applications**.

### **Differences Between Normalization and Denormalization**
| Feature           | Normalization        | Denormalization     |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Purpose         | Reduce redundancy, maintain integrity | Improve query performance |
| Data Redundancy | **Low** (minimized)  | **High** (increased) |
| Query Performance | Slower (requires joins) | Faster (fewer joins) |
| Storage Space   | Less (efficient)    | More (duplicated data) |
| Best For       | Transactional systems (OLTP) | Analytical systems (OLAP) |
